Notes from Matt: 

The "main.py" file is the primary python script so far.
The “bob.csv” file is a practice read-write file that was written by main.py.
main.py currently writes a csv file and names it with whatever you name your tank.

The directory pyserial-2.7 is sourcecode for interfacing with the arduino.
The py31eg directory has many great practice files from Mark Summerfield's book
"Programming in Python 3", but we are using python 2.* for the actual project.
